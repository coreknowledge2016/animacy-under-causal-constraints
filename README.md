# Demo for Perceiving Animacy with Causal Constraints.

## Exp1_Chasing With Causal Structure
Example demo in Exp.1 in the study of Perceiving Animacy with Causal Constraints. Motion of the Sheep and the Wolf were constructed from the same hierarchical motion tree. The other two objects were distractors.

## Exp1_ChasingWithoutCausalStructure
Example demo in Exp.1 in the study of Perceiving Animacy with Causal Constraints. Motion of the Sheep and the Wolf were constructed independently but kept same deviation. The other two objects were distractors.

## Exp2_Chasing With Causal Structure
Example demo in Exp.2 in the study of Perceiving Animacy with Causal Constraints. Motion of the Wolf and one of the Distractor were constructed from the same hierarchical motion tree. There was two distractors in the real experiment.

## Exp2_Chasing Without Causal Structure
Example demo in Exp.2 in the study of Perceiving Animacy with Causal Constraints. Motion of the Sheep and the Wolf were absolutely same as in With_Causal_Structure condition. But the distractor who shared same hierarchical motion tree with the wolf was replaced by another one. There was two distractors in the real experiment.
